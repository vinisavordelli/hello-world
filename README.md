Repository To Store Thing I Learn As a Beginner


Hello there.

Hi, My name is Vinicius Savordelli, currently I am 27 years old and an aspiring programmer;
I decided that my path to becoming a developer will start with learning web development (javascript, css, html, http, etc.);
In the future I aim to be a backend developer, but I need a path to get there, and this showed to be the best way for me, the second step being learning python;

Will update this repository when relevant information becomes available;
Bye bye.
